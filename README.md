# Wally

React Native WebDev project

Wally is an app that allows users to buy and sell second-hand goods with other users. The app integrates also an instant chat to communicate with buyers and sellers.

Users should sign up to start using the app. Then they can log in and post the items they want to sell or communicate with other users in order to buy an item or ask for further information. The user profile shows information about the items purchased, sold and favorite items as well as the static location of the user.

Items are organized by categories and they can be also found by static location. There is also a search engine to look for an specific item.

Besides, users can talk among themselves and the conversations are saved in a messages section.
